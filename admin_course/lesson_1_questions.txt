Question: Data Type Detective
# Description: Write a program that determines the data type of a given variable (e.g., integer, float, string, list). If integer, return "integer". If string, return "string". If list, return "list". If float, return "float".
# Example Input: x = 3
# Example Output: "Integer"
# Example Input: x = "dog"
# Example Output: "String"
def type_detective(x):
    pass

Question: Temperature Converter
# Description: Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F). Round to 1 digits. Return the converted temperature.
# Example Input: temperature = 3, convert_to = "F"
# Example Output: 37.4
# Example Input: temperature = 108, convert_to = "C"
# Example Output: 37.8
def temperature_converter(temperature, convert_to):
    pass

Question: Mean of list
# Description: Given a list of numbers, calculate and return the mean.
# Example Input: num_list = [2,3,5,5]
# Example Output: 3.75
def list_mean(l):
    pass

Question: Reverse String
# Description: Write a program that takes a user input string and returns it in reverse order, character by character.
# Example Input: st = "hello"
# Example Output: "olleh"
def reverse_string(s):
    pass

Question: String Manipulation
# Description: Given a string, reverse it without using the reverse() function or slicing. Return the reversed string. (Will need For loop)
# Example Input: st = "hello"
# Example Output: "olleh"
def reverse_string(s):
    pass

Question: Name Initials
# Description: Given a full name (separated by space), write a program that extracts the initials from the name and returns them to the user.
