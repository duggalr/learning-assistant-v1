Fibonacci Sequence: Write a Python program to generate the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop.
Multiplication Table: Write a Python program that generates a multiplication table for a given number (e.g., 7) up to a specified range (e.g., 10).
Palindrome Checker: Design a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards; ie. radar is a palindrome word), ignoring spaces and punctuation. Use a for loop to iterate through the characters.
Prime Checker: Create a program that prompts the user for an integer and determines whether its a prime number or not. Use a while loop to continuously ask for input until a prime number is entered.
Rock, Paper, Scissors: Create a text-based version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. Use a while loop to allow the player to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit. Keep track of their wins, losses, and ties.
