List-Append: Create an empty list. Use a for loop to add integers from 1 to 10 to the list.

Sum-Average: Generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. Calculate and display the total sum and average of the list.

Reverse-List: Write a Python program to reverse a given list without using list slicing or built-in functions. Return a new list, which is in reverse order.
# Example Input: 
l = [1,2,3,4]
# Example Output:
[4,3,2,1]

Odd-List: Given a list of numbers, create a new list that contains only the odd numbers from the original list.
# Example Input: 
l = [1,2,3,4]
# Example Output:
[1,3]

Squared-List: Write a program that takes a original list, and creates a new list, with each of the original number squared (ie. x ** 2).
# Example Input: 
l = [1,2,3,4]
# Example Output:
[1,4,9,16]

Item-Removal: Given a list of numbers, write a program that removes all occurrences of a specific number provided by the user, and returns a new list.
# Example Input: 
l = [1,2,3,4,3,7,3,11]
r = 3
# Example Output:
[1,2,4,7,11]

Duplicate-Removal: Given a list of numbers, write a program that finds and prints all unique elements in the list (no duplicates).
# Example Input: 
l = [1,2,3,4,3,7,1,3,11]
# Example Output:
[1,2,3,4,7,11]
