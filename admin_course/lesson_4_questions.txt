# Question: List-Append
# Description: Create an empty list. Use a for loop to add integers from 1 to 10 to the list.

# Question: Sum-Average
# Description: Generate a list of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. Calculate and display the total sum and average of the list.

# Question: Reverse-List
# Description: Write a Python program to reverse a given list without using list slicing or built-in functions. Return a new list, which is in reverse order.
# Example Input: l = [1,2,3,4]
# Example Output: [4,3,2,1]

# Question: Odd-List
# Description: Given a list of numbers, create a new list that contains only the odd numbers from the original list.
# Example Input: l = [1,2,3,4]
# Example Output: [1,3]

# Question: Squared-List
# Description: Write a program that takes a original list, and creates a new list, with each of the original number squared (ie. x ** 2).
# Example Input: l = [1,2,3,4]
# Example Output: [1,4,9,16]

# Question: Item-Removal
# Description: Given a list of numbers, write a program that removes all occurrences of a specific number provided by the user, and returns a new list.
# Example Input: l = [1,2,3,4,3,7,3,11], r = 3
# Example Output: [1,2,4,7,11]

# Question: Duplicate-Removal
# Description: Given a list of numbers, write a program that finds and prints all unique elements in the list (no duplicates).
# Example Input: l = [1,2,3,4,3,7,1,3,11]
# Example Output: [1,2,3,4,7,11]

# Question: Maximum Sum
# Description: Given a list of numbers, write a program that returns the maximum sum of 2 numbers in the list (Think through this problem.)
# Example Input: l = [3,1,4,7]
# Example Output: 11
# Example Input: l = [10,1,0,7,9]
# Example Output: 19
