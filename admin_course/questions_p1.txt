Lesson 1: Variables, Data Types, String Manipulation
Welcome to Lesson 1 of your programming journey! In this lesson, you will dive into the foundational concepts of programming, focusing on variables, data types, and string manipulation in Python. These are essential building blocks that every programmer needs to master.
Prerequisite Knowledge:
TODO: link to the W3 links below and any other information. Save the data in DB and show in FE (just for lesson 1 to start with); go from there...
Before we get started, let's review some basic concepts that will be helpful in this lesson:
Variables: These are like containers that hold data.
Data Types: Python has several data types, including integers, floats, strings, and lists.
User Input: You've learned how to get input from users.

Data Type Detective: Write a program that determines the data type of a given input (e.g., integer, float, string, list). If integer, print "Integer". If string, print "String". If list, print "List". If float, print "Float".
Temperature Converter: Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Prompt the user for input and perform the conversion.
User Input Statistics: Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. Calculate and display the mean, median, and mode of the numbers.
Reverse String: Write a program that takes a user input string and prints it in reverse order, character by character (Hint: ask gpt for help on how to reverse a list).
String Manipulation: Given a string, reverse it without using the reverse() function or slicing. (Hint: For loop)
Name Initials: Ask the user for their full name (first name and last name). Write a program that extracts the initials from the name and displays them in uppercase.
