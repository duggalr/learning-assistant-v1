# Variables, Data Types, String Manipulation:
Data Type Detective: Write a program that determines the data type of a given input (e.g., integer, float, string, list). If integer, print "Integer". If string, print "String". If list, print "List". If float, print "Float".
Temperature Converter: Create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Prompt the user for input and perform the conversion.
User Input Statistics: Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. Calculate and display the mean, median, and mode of the numbers.
Reverse String: Write a program that takes a user input string and prints it in reverse order, character by character (Hint: ask gpt for help on how to reverse a list).
String Manipulation: Given a string, reverse it without using the reverse() function or slicing. (Hint: For loop)
