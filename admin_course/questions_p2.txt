Lesson 2: For/While Loops & Booleans & Conditionals (If/Else)
Temperature Classifier: Write a program that takes a temperature (in Celsius) as input and classifies it as "Hot (if temperature > 25)", "Moderate (if temperature between 5 and 25)" or "Cold (if temperature below 5)".
BMI Calculator: Create a program that calculates a person's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. Provide a message indicating their weight status (e.g., "Underweight," "Normal," "Overweight," "Obese").
- BMI = weight / (height)**2
- Example: 
    - Below 18.5 --> Underweight
    - 18.5 – 24.9 --> Healthy Weight
    - 25.0 – 29.9 --> Overweight
    - 30.0 and Above --> Obesity
Fibonacci Sequence: Write a Python program to generate the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence using a for loop. 
Multiplication Table: Write a Python program that generates a multiplication table for a given number (e.g., 7) up to a specified range (e.g., 10). 
Palindrome Checker: Design a program that checks if a given word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards; ie. 'radar' is a palindrome word), ignoring spaces and punctuation. Use a for loop to iterate through the characters.
Prime Checker: Create a program that prompts the user for an integer and determines whether it's a prime number or not. Use a while loop to continuously ask for input until a prime number is entered.
Rock, Paper, Scissors: Create a text-based version of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. Use a while loop to allow the player to play multiple rounds until they choose to quit. Keep track of their wins, losses, and ties.
