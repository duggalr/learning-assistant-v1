Write a function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and returns them in a list. (see w3 to get the basics of functions and how they work)
Design a function that takes a string as input and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each character (letters, digits, and symbols) in the string.
Implement a hangman game with functions. Write functions for initializing the game, checking guesses, and displaying the game state. Allow the player to keep playing rounds until they choose to quit. (this is a bigger task and will take more thought)
