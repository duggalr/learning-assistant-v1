Description: This course outline is designed to introduce the student to basic ciphers, specifically focusing on substitution ciphers, to aid in the encryption and decryption of messages. The student's goal is to eventually create a program that can encrypt messages to be sent via a URL, which only the student can decrypt. The course will be structured in a way that progresses at a reasonable pace, considering the student's comfort level with Python and eagerness to learn despite not having strong mathematical skills. The outline can be adjusted based on the student's progress and interests throughout the duration.
