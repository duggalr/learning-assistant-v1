["The student wants to learn about basic ciphers, starting with substitutions, in order to encrypt and decrypt messages. They are interested in using this knowledge to create a program that allows a friend to send an encrypted message via a URL that only the student can decrypt. The student intends to use Python for implementation of any cryptographic algorithms and has a comfort level with this programming language. Despite lack of strong mathematical skills, the student is eager to understand and apply the logic behind these ciphers. The student has allotted around 10 hours per week for this learning and project implementation journey."]
