["Course Notes: Fundamentals of Cryptography - Week 1: Definition and Basics of Cryptography",
"Introduction:",
"Cryptography is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties, more commonly referred to as adversaries. Its primary objective is to enable private messages to be sent across a public channel where potentially anyone could be eavesdropping.",
"Given your interest in creating a program that allows for encrypted messaging via URL, it's important to first grasp the basic principles and definitions that form the foundation of cryptography.",
"1. What is Cryptography?",
"Cryptography involves creating written or generated codes that allow information to be kept secret. Cryptography converts data into a format that is unreadable for an unauthorized user, allowing it to be transmitted without unauthorized entities decoding it back into a readable format, thus compromising the data.",
"2. Symmetric-key Cryptography:",
"One of the first concepts in cryptography is the use of symmetric-key algorithms. In this method, the same key is used for both encryption (converting plain text into ciphertext) and decryption (converting ciphertext back to plain text). The key represents a shared secret between the parties that can communicate securely.",
"Examples include algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), and ChaCha20.",
"3. Substitution Ciphers:",
"Substitution ciphers are a type of symmetric encryption where each element of the plaintext is replaced with another corresponding element to produce ciphertext. A simple example is the Caesar cipher, where letters are shifted by a certain number down or up the alphabet.",
"For your project, learning the basics of substitution ciphers can be a starting point since they introduce the concept of changing plaintext to ciphertext using a key.",
"4. Importance of Key Management:",
"A crucial part of symmetric-key cryptography is key management. Since the same key is used for encryption and decryption, securely sharing and storing this key is of paramount importance. Loss or theft of the key means that the encrypted messages can be decrypted by unauthorized parties.",
"5. Developing a Simple Encryption Program:",
"With your background in Python, you can start experimenting by writing a basic program that uses a simple substitution cipher for encryption and decryption.",
"Python Code Snippet - Simple Substitution Cipher:",
```python",
"def encrypt_decrypt(input_string, key, mode='encrypt'):",
"    result = ''",
"    for char in input_string:",
"        if mode == 'encrypt':",
"            result += chr((ord(char) + key) % 256)",
"        elif mode == 'decrypt':",
"            result += chr((ord(char) - key) % 256)",
"    return result",
"",
"# Example usage",
"original_msg = 'Hello World!'",
"key = 5 # Simple numeric key",
"encrypted_msg = encrypt_decrypt(original_msg, key)",
"decrypted_msg = encrypt_decrypt(encrypted_msg, key, mode='decrypt')",
"",
"print('Original:', original_msg)",
"print('Encrypted:', encrypted_msg)",
"print('Decrypted:', decrypted_msg)",
"```",
"6. Conclusion:",
"This week, we've touched upon the very basics of cryptography, focusing on symmetric-key cryptography and how substitution ciphers can be a good entry point into the world of encryption and decryption. Remember, the key to effective cryptography is not just in the complexity of the algorithm but in how securely the keys are managed and exchanged.",
"Next Week: As we move forward, we will delve into asymmetric cryptography, exploring how it solves the problem of key exchange which plagues the symmetric system and laying the groundwork for your messaging application."]
