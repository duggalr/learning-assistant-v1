### Course Notes: Fundamentals of Cryptography

#### Week 1: Introduction to Cryptography

Welcome to your first steps in understanding the complex yet fascinating world of cryptography! This week, we'll take you through the foundational concepts of cryptography, which is the science of securing communication. By mastering these basics, you will be well on your path to utilizing cryptography for your project of creating a secure message exchange program in Python. Remember, these notes are tailored to your goals and background, making the complex simple and engaging.

##### **Definition and Basics of Cryptography**

- **Cryptography** is the art of creating techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It enables the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of information.
    - ***Confidentiality*** means keeping the content hidden from anyone but the intended recipient.
    - ***Integrity*** ensures that the content has not been altered in transit.
    - ***Authenticity*** refers to verifying the sender's identity.
    - ***Non-repudiation*** prevents the sender from denying sending the message.

##### **Symmetric vs Asymmetric Key Cryptography**

- **Symmetric-Key Cryptography:** The same key is used for encryption and decryption. Algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and DES (Data Encryption Standard). It's efficient for bulk encryption due to relatively small key sizes and fast operation.
    - *Example:* AES is widely adopted and considered secure against quantum computing threats with a 256-bit key.

- **Asymmetric-Key Cryptography (Public Key Cryptography):** Uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Algorithms include RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). It's used for secure key distribution and digital signatures but is generally slower than symmetric methods.
    - *Real-Life Application:* SSL/TLS for secure web browsing.

##### **Importance and Real-life Application of Cryptography**

- Cryptography protects sensitive data in many fields such as banking for secure transactions (using protocols like TLS), personal privacy (encryption of messages like WhatsApp), and secure software updates (digital signatures).

##### **Introduction to Python Libraries for Cryptography**

- **`cryptography` library in Python:** This modern library provides both high-level recipes and low-level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, hashing, and public-key operations. We will use this library for implementing our algorithms.

    - Installation: ```pip install cryptography```
    - Symmetric Encryption Example (AES):
        ```python
        from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
        from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
        import os

        key = os.urandom(32)  # Generates a 256-bit secret key
        iv = os.urandom(16)   # Initialization vector
        backend = default_backend()
        cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key), modes.CFB(iv), backend=backend)
        encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
        ct = encryptor.update(b"a secret message") + encryptor.finalize()

        decryptor = cipher.decryptor()
        original_message = decryptor.update(ct) + decryptor.finalize()
        print(original_message)
        ```

- **Understanding and Implementing Cryptographic Algorithms:** As your project involves both encrypting and decrypting messages via URLs, start by focusing on understanding symmetric encryption with Python. Practice by implementing simple algorithms like Caesar Cipher in Python before moving on to more advanced algorithms like AES provided by the `cryptography` library.

Remember, the journey of mastering cryptography is a marathon, not a sprint. This week, focus on understanding these core concepts and playing around with the Python `cryptography` library to get comfortable with implementing basic encryption and decryption tasks. Next week, we will delve deeper into ciphers, starting with the historical Caesar Cipher and understanding its workings and limitations. Start thinking of how you can use what you've learned to build your message encryption program. 

Happy coding!
