["Course Notes: Week 1 - Fundamentals of Cryptography",
"### Definition and Basics of Cryptography",
"Cryptography is the science of secure communication in the presence of adversaries. It ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data. Confidentiality means keeping data secret from unauthorized parties, integrity means ensuring data has not been altered, and authenticity means verifying the source of data.",
"",
"### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Key Cryptography",
"- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. This method is efficient for encrypting large amounts of data but faces challenges in secure key distribution. Examples include AES and DES.",
"- **Asymmetric Key Cryptography**: Uses a pair of keys, a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This solves the key distribution problem of symmetric cryptography but is computationally more intensive. Examples include RSA and ECC.",
"",
"### Importance and Real-life Applications of Cryptography",
"Cryptography is crucial for securing online transactions, protecting personal information, and ensuring the security of communication channels. Real-life applications include HTTPS for secure web browsing, encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, and blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.",
"",
"### Introduction to Python Libraries for Cryptography",
"Python provides several libraries for implementing cryptographic algorithms, two of the most popular being PyCrypto and Cryptography. PyCrypto is a collection of secure hash functions and various encryption algorithms, while Cryptography is a package that provides cryptographic recipes and primitives.",
"",
"### Supplementary Material: Understanding Symmetric-Key Cryptography",
"- **Symmetric-key algorithms** are fundamental in cryptography, providing efficient means for encryption that are generally faster and more suitable for large data volumes than their asymmetric counterparts.",
"- The process involves a single key for both encryption and decryption, making key management a critical aspect. Algorithms like AES are widely used for their balance of speed and security.",
"- Security challenges such as known-plaintext attacks, chosen-plaintext attacks, and vulnerabilities to quantum computing are important considerations. To mitigate these, enhancing key lengths and ensuring secure key exchange mechanisms are crucial.",
"- Key management in symmetric systems demands secure methods for key establishment, often leveraging asymmetric techniques for the initial exchange.",
"- Symmetric encryption can adopt various approaches like stream ciphers for encrypting data in a continuous stream or block ciphers for encrypting data in fixed-size blocks. Each method has its trade-offs between security and performance.",

"### Interactive Python Example: Basic Cryptography",
"```python",
"from Crypto.Cipher import AES",
"# Key and initialization vector (IV)",
"key = b'Sixteen byte key'",
"iv = b'This is an IV456'",
"# AES cipher",
"cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)",
"# Encrypting a message",
"msg = cipher.encrypt(b'This is a secret message. We will encrypt it')",
"print('Encrypted message:', msg)",
"# Decrypting the message",
"decrypt_cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)",
"original_message = decrypt_cipher.decrypt(msg)",
"print('Decrypted message:', original_message)",
"```",
"This example demonstrates basic usage of the AES algorithm for encryption and decryption using Python's PyCrypto library. The AES cipher is initialized with a key and an IV, and then used to encrypt and decrypt a message.",

"Learning about symmetric vs asymmetric cryptography, and the importance of cryptography in modern applications sets a strong foundation for diving into more advanced topics, including the specifics of various ciphers and their Python implementations in upcoming sessions."]
