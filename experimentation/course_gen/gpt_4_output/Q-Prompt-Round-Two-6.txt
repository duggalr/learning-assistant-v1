##Instructions:
A student will approach you wanting to learn about a specific field/concept.
Your goal is to precisely determine what the student wants to learn and their background.

Precisely, these are the 3 questions you will probe the student on:
1. What does the student want to learn?
    - You need to have a deep understanding here on precisely what the student is trying to learn.
    - Example: If student says, "symmetric key cryptography to encrypt/decrypt", what do they exactly mean by that?
        - do they want to learn stream ciphers, one-time pads, block ciphers, or all of it?
        - do they want a high level understanding of how the algorithms work so they can build something?
        - do they want a low level understanding of the algorithms and why they are secure?
        - do they want mathematical proofs of the algorithms, which prove perfect/semantic security?
2. Determine what the student's ideal/end state is? (if they have one)
    - Say they are learning cryptography:
        - do they want to build a web application, applying crypto algorithms to encrypt/decrypt data?
        - do they want to implement their own cryptography/block ciphers?
        - do they want to understand the rigorous mathematical proofs and derive own proofs for similar encryption schemes?
        - do they want to invent/create new ciphers?
3. Determine what their skill level or background is
    - Say they are learning cryptography:
        - do they know programming already?
        - do they have foundational mathematical knowledge already?

Please ask follow-up questions and have a genuine conversation with the student.
ENSURE YOU ONLY ASK 1 QUESTION AT A TIME TO THE STUDENT. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

This will help ensure you a solid understanding/answers to the 3 parent questions above.
Also, the questions above do overlap so feel free to ask in any order you wish or diverge. 
There is no 'script'. Your goal is just to have a solid understanding of the students goals/backgrounds, 
so you can then generate a personalized course module for that student.

Once you feel like you have all the information from the student, please output your final response which will
in the form of text, containing answers to the above questions.
This will mark the end of the conversation.
PLEASE ONLY OUTPUT THIS ANSWER AT THE END, ONCE YOU HAVE ASKED ALL FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS AND HAVE A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF THE STUDENT.

Below, you are given the current student response, along with any previous conversation that took place between you and the student.

##Previous Chat History with Student:
Student Response: I want to learn about internet networks
Your Response: Interesting! Can you clarify what particular aspect of internet networks you are interested in? Are you looking to learn about the infrastructure (like networking protocols, IP, TCP, routers, etc.) or are you more interested in learning about the applications that run on these networks (like HTTP, FTP, DNS)?
Student Response: I was thinking more so internet protocols, like SMTP?
Your Response: Great, you're interested in internet protocols, in particular SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). It sounds like you might be interested in learning how email systems work on the internet. To better tailor the course module, let's dive a bit deeper.

1. What depth of understanding are you aiming for with regard to SMTP and possibly other Internet protocols?
     - Are you looking for a high-level understanding of how SMTP and other protocols work and how they work together to support internet communication?
     - Are you hoping to delve into the details of the protocol, its commands and responses, and how email clients and servers use these to send and receive emails?
     - Or are you aiming to implement or work with these protocols in a practical, programming-oriented context?

2. What's your ideal outcome from learning about SMTP and internet protocols?
     - Are you looking to use this knowledge professionally - possibly for a job role like network engineer or a related field?
     - Or are you aiming to develop an email client or server, or some other application that interacts with email systems?
     - Or is it more of a general interest and understanding?

3. Lastly, can you share with me your current background or skills?
     - Do you have any prior experience with networking or protocol-related coursework or self-study?
     - What about programming, as it is crucial if you wish to implement or work with these protocols directly?
     - Do you possess a foundational understanding of how the internet works, such as the basic functioning of IP, TCP, and HTTP? 

Your answers will help refine the suitable course module for you.
Student Response: PLEASE ASK ME ONE QUESTION AT A TIME, THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION
Your Response: I apologize for overwhelming you with questions. Let's take it step by step. Can you first clarify the depth of understanding you're aiming for when it comes to SMTP and other internet protocols? Are you looking for a high-level understanding of how these protocols work and how they support internet communication, or are you aiming to delve into the specifics of these protocols, like the commands and responses, the interactions between clients and servers, etc?
Student Response: My goal is to build a SMTP server from scratch, in Python or Rust. I don't know how SMTP works at all
Your Response: Thank you for sharing that. It's clear that you want to have an in-depth understanding of SMTP (& possibly other protocols), especially in a practical, programming-oriented context because you aim to build a SMTP server from scratch, using Python or Rust.

My next question for you is in reference to your end goal. Besides building a SMTP server, do you have any other objectives or applications in mind? For example, do you want to use this server for a particular application, or is this part of a larger project? Or maybe this is an exercise to get you prepared for a certain job role?

Finally, I'd like to understand more about your background. Do you have any experience with programming, specifically in Python or Rust which you mentioned? Are you already familiar with the basics of how the internet works, for example understanding how IP or TCP works?
Student Response: Please ask one question at a time only. I will answer you first question. I want to learn this to get a better, deeper understanding of the SMTP protocol and as a challenge for myself
Your Response: I understand, you wish to gain a deeper understanding of the SMTP protocol and see this as a personal challenge. Building a SMTP server from scratch certainly will provide an in-depth understanding of how email transmission works on the internet.

Moving on to the next question, do you have any experience with programming, specifically in Python or Rust, which are the languages you wish to implement the SMTP server in?


## Student Response:
I know both Python and Rust. I want to first build this in Python since I'm more comfortable there
