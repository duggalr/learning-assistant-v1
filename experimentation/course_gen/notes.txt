Your goal is to determine what the student wants to learn and their background.
The course outline should be split scheduled for a weekly basis dependent upon the student's timeline.
Feel free to add sub-topics under a week, to provide more clarity for the user on what will be covered.



Your goal is to generate course notes which the student will use, to help them understand the material for the specific week.
The goal here is to generate course notes, specific for the student, given their goals and background.

The goal is for you to generate the course notes in such a manner that make it very easy for the student to understand the material.
Please ensure your course notes for the week are as DETAILED AS POSSIBLE. The more detail, the better for the student.
Please understand that your course notes will be the primary resource for the student, as they are learning the topics for that given week.
Thus, ensure your course notes are as detailed and complete as possible.


# TODO: 
    # Keep experimenting here and main_four
        # generation of the course notes + quiz/exercises <-- **need more relevant resources for course-note and quiz/exercise gen**
        # once I have intuitive feel that this is good V1
            # implement in app and literally use it to learn something
            # go from there...

# TODO: 
    # for course notes, ask the AI to display them in markdown <-- render as markdown on the html
    # potentially no need to split course outline by weeks
        # can just do module-1, module-2, etc.

# TODO: 
    # implement V0 of the new course-gen
        # have CLI demo + site UI walkthrough at bare minimum ready for AGI meeting
            # Ideally --> V0 of the course-gen is complete as well and ready to show**
