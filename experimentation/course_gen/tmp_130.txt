Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly
computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and
software which enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to
take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called
AIs.

AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile
applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems
(used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri,
and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT and AI
art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).[2] However, many AI
applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications,
often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough
it's not labeled AI anymore."[3][4]

Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine
intelligence.[5] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[6] The field went
through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding,
known as AI winter.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning
surpassed all previous AI techniques,[11] and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.[12] This led
to the AI boom of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly
based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.[13]

The growing use of artificial intelligence in the 21st century is influencing a societal and economic
shift towards increased automation, data-driven decision-making, and the integration of AI systems
into various economic sectors and areas of life, impacting job markets, healthcare, government,
industry, and education. This raises questions about the long-term effects, ethical implications, and
risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the
technology.

The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular
tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning,
learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—
the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the
field's long-term goals.[14]

An ontology represents knowledge as a set
of concepts within a domain and the
relationships between those concepts.

To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques,
including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods
based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics,
philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[15]

The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems.
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to
display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI
research.[a]

Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when
they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[16] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were
developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability
and economics.[17]

Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they
experience a "combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew
larger.[18] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model.
They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[19] Accurate and efficient reasoning
is an unsolved problem.

Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[20]

allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and
make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge
representations are used in content-based indexing and
retrieval,[21] scene interpretation,[22] clinical decision
support,[23] knowledge discovery (mining "interesting" and
actionable inferences from large databases),[24] and other
areas.[25]

A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a
form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of
objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a
particular domain of knowledge.[26] Knowledge bases need
to represent things such as: objects, properties, categories
and relations between objects;[27] situations, events, states
and time;[28] causes and effects;[29] knowledge about
knowledge (what we know about what other people

know);[30] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and
will remain true even when other facts are changing);[31] and many other aspects and domains of
knowledge.

Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: the breadth of commonsense
knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[32] and the sub-
symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as
"facts" or "statements" that they could express verbally).[19] There is also the difficulty of knowledge
acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c]

An "agent" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or
preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][35] In automated planning, the agent has a
specific goal.[36] In automated decision making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations
it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision making agent assigns a
number to each situation (called the "utility") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each
possible action, it can calculate the "expected utility": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action,
weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the
maximum expected utility.[37]

In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[38] In most real-
world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is
"unknown" or "unobservable") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible
action (it is not "deterministic"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then
reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[39]

In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or
humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning) or the agent can
seek information to improve its preferences.[40] Information value theory can be used to weigh the
value of exploratory or experimental actions.[41] The space of possible future actions and situations is
typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being
uncertain what the outcome will be.

A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular
action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each
state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy
could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[42]

Game theory describes rational behavior of multiple interacting agents, and is used in AI programs
that make decisions that involve other agents.[43]

Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task
automatically.[44] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e]

There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and
finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[47] Supervised learning requires a
human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program
must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must
deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[48]

In reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The
agent learns to choose responses that are classified as "good".[49] Transfer learning is when the
knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[50] Deep learning is a type of
machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of
these types of learning.[51]

Computational learning theory can assess learner
