 | s by computational complexity, by sample
complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[52]

Natural language processing (NLP)[53] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human
languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine
translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[54]

Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty
with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called "micro-worlds" (due to
the common sense knowledge problem[32]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning, and
not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries
should be the basis of computational language structure.

Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as
vectors encoding their meaning),[55] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention
mechanism),[56] and others.[57] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or "GPT") language
models began to generate coherent text,[58][59] and by 2023 these models were able to get human-
level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[60]

Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless
signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision
is the ability to analyze visual input.[61]

The field includes speech recognition,[62] image classification,[63] facial recognition, object
recognition,[64] and robotic perception.[65]

Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret,
process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[67] For example, some virtual assistants are
programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more

sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to
otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.

However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception
of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[68] Moderate
successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment
analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis,
wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped
subject.[69]

A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to
solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[14]

AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b]

AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[70] There are
two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.

State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[71] For example,
planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target
goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[72]

Simple exhaustive searches[73] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space
(the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is
too slow or never completes.[18] "Heuristics" or "rules of thumb" can help to prioritize choices that are
more likely to reach a goal.[74]

Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree
of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.[75]

Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form
of guess and refines it incrementally.[76]

Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by
incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly
used to train neural networks.[77]

different starting points. Two
parameters (represented by the plan
coordinates) are adjusted in order to
minimize the loss function (the
height).

Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which
aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by
"mutating" and "recombining" them, selecting only the fittest to
survive each generation.[78]

Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm
intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in
search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking)
and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[79]

Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge
representation.[80] Formal logic comes in two main forms:
propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or
false and uses logical connectives such as "and", "or", "not" and
"implies")[81] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses
quantifiers such as "Every X is a Y" and "There are some Xs that are Ys").[82]

Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other
statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[83] Proofs can be structured as proof
trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by
inference rules.

Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose
root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or
axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards
from the premises or backwards from the problem.[84] In the more general case of the clausal form of
first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by
proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[85]

Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable.
However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic
programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with
computation in other symbolic programming languages.[86]

Fuzzy logic assigns a "degree of truth" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are
vague and partially true.[87]

Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle
default reasoning.[31] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many
complex domains.

Faithful eruption data starts from a random

Many problems in AI (including in
reasoning, planning, learning, perception,
and robotics) require the agent to operate
with incomplete or uncertain information.
AI researchers have devised a number of
tools to solve these problems using methods
from probability theory and economics.[88]

Precise mathematical tools have been
developed that analyze how an agent can
make choices and plan, using decision
theory, decision analysis,[89] and
information value theory.[90] These tools
include models such as Markov decision
processes,[91] dynamic decision
networks,[92] game theory and mechanism design.[93]

Bayesian networks[94] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference
algorithm),[g][96] learning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[h][98] planning (using
decision networks)[99] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[92]

Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations
for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden
Markov models or Kalman filters).[92]

The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types:
classifiers (e.g., "if shiny then diamond"), on one hand, and
controllers (e.g., "if diamond then pick up"), on the other
hand. Classifiers[100] are functions that use pattern matching
to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based
on chosen examples using supervised le
