Applications of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Similar to
electricity or computers, AI serves as a general-purpose technology that has numerous applications. Its
applications span language translation, image recognition, decision-making,[1] credit scoring, e-commerce and
various other domains.[2]

A recommendation system predicts the rating or preference a user would give to an item.[3][4] Artificial
intelligence recommendation systems are designed to offer suggestions based on previous behavior. These
systems have been used by companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube, where they generate personalized
playlists, product suggestions, and video recommendations.[5][6]

Machine learning is also used in web feeds such as for determining which posts should show up in social media
feeds.[7][8] Various types of social media analysis also make use of machine learning[9][10] and there is research
into its use for (semi-)automated tagging/enhancement/correction of online misinformation and related filter
bubbles.[11][12][13]

AI is used to target web advertisements to those most likely to click or engage in them. It is also used to increase
time spent on a website by selecting attractive content for the viewer. It can predict or generalize the behavior of
customers from their digital footprints.[14] Both AdSense and Facebook[15] use AI for advertising.

Online gambling companies use AI to improve customer targeting.[16]

Personality computing AI models add psychological targeting to more traditional social demographics or
behavioral targeting.[17] AI has been used to customize shopping options and personalize offers.[18]

Intelligent personal assistants use AI to understand many natural language requests in other ways than
rudimentary commands. Common examples are Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and a more recent AI, ChatGPT
by OpenAI.[19]

Search engines that use artificial intelligence include Google Search[20] and Bing Chat.

Machine learning can be used to fight against spam, scams, and phishing. It can scrutinize the contents of spam
and phishing attacks to identify any malicious elements.[21] Numerous models built on machine learning
algorithms exhibit exceptional performance with accuracies over 90% in distinguishing between spam and
legitimate emails.[22]

AI has been used to automatically translate spoken language and textual content, in products such as Microsoft
Translator, Google Translate and DeepL Translator.[23] Additionally, research and development are in progress
to decode and conduct animal communication.[24][25]

AI has been used in facial recognition systems, with a 99% accuracy rate. Some examples are Apple's Face ID
and Android's Face Unlock, which are used to secure mobile devices.[26]

Image labeling has been used by Google to detect products in photos and to allow people to search based on a
photo. Image labeling has also been demonstrated to generate speech to describe images to blind people. [27]

Facebook's DeepFace identifies human faces in digital images.

Games have been a major application of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have beaten
human players in many games, including chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy! (Watson),[28] Go
(AlphaGo),[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] poker (Pluribus[36] and Cepheus),[37] E-sports (StarCraft),[38][39] and
general game playing (AlphaZero[40][41][42] and MuZero).[43][44][45][46] AI has replaced hand-coded algorithms
in most chess programs.[47] Unlike go or chess, poker is an imperfect-information game, so a program that
plays poker has to reason under uncertainty. The general game players work using feedback from the game
system, without knowing the rules.

AI for Good is an ITU initiative supporting institutions employing AI to tackle some of the world's greatest
economic and social challenges. For example, the University of Southern California launched the Center for
Artificial Intelligence in Society, with the goal of using AI to address problems such as homelessness. At
Stanford, researchers use AI to analyze satellite images to identify high poverty areas.[48]

In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or
increasing yield.[49] Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the
ripening time for crops such as tomatoes,[50] monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct
predictive analytics,[51][52] classify livestock pig call emotions,[24] automate greenhouses,[53] detect diseases and
pests,[54][55] and save water.[56]

Cyber security companies are adopting neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing to
improve their systems.[57]

Applications of AI in cyber security include:

Language translation

Facial recognition and image labeling

Games

Economic and social challenges

Agriculture

Network protection: Machine learning improves intrusion detection systems by broadening the search
beyond previously identified threats.
Endpoint protection: Attacks such as ransomware can be thwarted by learning typical malware behaviors.
Application security: can help counterattacks such as server-side request forgery, SQL injection, cross-site
scripting, and distributed denial-of-service.
Suspect user behavior: Machine learning can identify fraud or compromised applications as they occur.[58]

Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has said that AI will be used to completely automate most cyber
security operations over time.[59]

AI tutors such as Khanmigo and Duolingo allow students to get one-on-one help.[60] They can reduce anxiety
and stress for students stemming from tutor labs or human tutors.[61]

AI applications that hinder students' ability to stay on task, such as recommender systems, can create a
dysfunctional environment, sometimes with revenge effects.[62][63] AI can be also used to provide early
prediction of student success in a virtual learning environment (VLE) such as Moodle.[64]

In the education process, students can personalize their training with the help of artificial intelligence. And for
teaching professionals, the technology provided by AI can improve the quality of the educational process and
teaching skills.[65]

Since the launch of OpenAI's API in 2022, some students have used the software to generate their essay
assignments.[66] AI text detectors can be used to scan essays generated by artificial intelligence in order to try to
establish genuine authorship. However, a study found that seven of the most used of these detectors often
wrongly flagged articles written by those whose first language was not English as AI-generated, thus
discriminating against so called 'non-native' English speakers.[67]

Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the
norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking began in 1987 when Security Pacific
National Bank launched a fraud prevention taskforce to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[68] Kasisto
and Moneystream use AI.

Banks use AI to organize operations, for bookkeeping, investing in stocks, and managing properties. AI can
react to changes when business is not taking place.[69] AI is used to combat fraud and financial crimes by
monitoring behavioral patterns for any abnormal changes or anomalies.[70][71][72]

The use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic
theories.[73] For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate individualized demand and supply
curves and thus enable individualized pricing. AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and
thus make markets more efficient.[74] The application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry can
alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises. Especially for smaller and more innovative
enterprises.[75]

Algorithmic trading involves the use of AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds orders of magnitude
greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Such
high-frequency trading represents a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now

have entire portfolios that are AI-managed. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional
investors but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems.[76]

Large financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is
used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions include the use of
natural language processing to analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges
the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use
SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles
and match them with wealth management products.[77]

Online lender Upstart uses machine learning for underwriting.[78]

ZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This
platform uses machine learning to analyze data including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a
form to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit
histories.[79]

AI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of
assurance, and reducing audit duration.[80]

AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used for anti-
money laundering (AML).[81][82] AI can be used to "develop the AML pipeline into a robust, scalable solution
with a reduced false p
