never been able to be done before without an extremely large team.[281]

Lede AI has been used in 2023 to take scores from high school football games to generate stories automatically
for the local news paper. This was met with a lot of criticism from readers for the very robotic diction that was
published. With some descriptions of games being a "close encounter of the athletic kind," readers were not
pleased and let the publishing company, Gannett, know on social media. Gannett has since halted their used of
Lede AI until they come up with a solution for what they call an experiment.[282]

Artificial intelligence is used in Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects for the purpose of developing those
projects.[283][284] Human and bot interaction in Wikimedia projects is routine and iterative.[285]

Millions of its articles have been edited by bots[286] which however are usually not artificial intelligence
software. Many AI platforms use Wikipedia data,[287] mainly for training machine learning applications. There
is research and development of various artificial intelligence applications for Wikipedia such as for identifying
outdated sentences,[288] detecting covert vandalism[289] or recommending articles and tasks to new editors.

Machine translation has also be used for translating Wikipedia articles and could play a larger role in creating,
updating, expanding, and generally improving articles in the future. A content translation tool allows editors of
some Wikipedias to more easily translate articles across several select languages.[290][291]

In video games, AI is routinely used to generate behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, AI is
used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production
tasks. Games with less typical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) and the neuroevolutionary
training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010).[292][293] AI is also used in Alien Isolation (2014) as a
way to control the actions the Alien will perform next.[294]

Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that
emerged from AI research.[295]

AI has been used to produce visual art. The first AI art program, called
AARON, was developed by Harold Cohen in 1968[296] with the goal of being
able to code the act of drawing. It started by creating simple black and white
drawings, and later to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen
by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.[297]

AI platforms such as "DALL-E",[298] Stable Diffusion,[298] Imagen,[299] and
Midjourney[300] have been used for generating visual images from inputs
such as text or other images.[301] Some AI tools allow users to input images
and output changed versions of that image, such as to display an object or
product in different environments. AI image models can also attempt to
replicate the specific styles of artists, and can add visual complexity to rough
sketches.

Since their design in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have
been used by AI artists. GAN computer programming, generates technical images through machine learning
frameworks that surpass the need for human operators.[296] Examples of GAN programs that generate art
include Artbreeder and DeepDream.

In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively
analyze digital art collections. Although the main goal of the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few
decades was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has
brought about new research perspectives.[302] Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing,
are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.[303] While distant viewing includes the analysis of large
collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork.

AI has been in use since the early 2000s, most notably by a system designed by Pixar called "Genesis".[304] It
was designed to learn algorithms and create 3D models for its characters and props. Notable movies that used
this technology included Up and The Good Dinosaur.[305] AI has been used less ceremoniously in recent years.
In 2023, it was revealed Netflix of Japan was using AI to generate background images for their upcoming show

to be met with backlash online.[306] In recent years, motion capture became an easily accessible form of AI
animation. For example, Move AI is a program built to capture any human movement and reanimate it in its
animation program using learning AI.[307]

Power electronics converters are used in renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicles and high-voltage
direct current transmission. These converters are failure-prone, which can interrupt service and require costly
maintenance or catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications. AI can guide the design process for
reliable power electronics converters, by calculating exact design parameters that ensure the required
lifetime.[308]

Machine learning can be used for energy consumption prediction and scheduling, e.g. to help with renewable
energy intermittency management (see also: smart grid and climate change mitigation in the power
grid).[309][310][311][312]

Many telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search to manage their workforces. For example,
BT Group deployed heuristic search[313] in an application that schedules 20,000 engineers. Machine learning is
also used for speech recognition (SR), including of voice-controlled devices, and SR-related transcription,
including of videos.[314][315]

Artificial intelligence has been combined with digital spectrometry by IdeaCuria Inc.,[316][317] enable
applications such as at-home water quality monitoring.

In the 1990s early AIs controlled Tamagotchis and Giga Pets, the Internet, and the first widely released robot,
Furby. Aibo was a domestic robot in the form of a robotic dog with intelligent features and autonomy.

Mattel created an assortment of AI-enabled toys that "understand" conversations, give intelligent responses,
and learn.[318]

Oil and gas companies have used artificial intelligence tools to automate functions, foresee equipment issues,
and increase oil and gas output.[319][320]

AI in transport is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable
transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and
communities. The major development challenge is the complexity of
transportation systems that involves independent components and parties,
with potentially conflicting objectives.[321]

AI-based fuzzy logic controllers operate gearboxes. For example, the 2006
Audi TT, VW Touareg and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission. A
number of Škoda variants (Škoda Fabia) include a fuzzy logic-based
controller. Cars have AI-based driver-assist features such as self-parking
and adaptive cruise control.

There are also prototypes of autonomous automotive public transport vehicles such as electric mini-
buses[322][323][324][325] as well as autonomous rail transport in operation.[326][327][328]

There also are prototypes of autonomous delivery vehicles, sometimes including delivery
robots.[329][330][331][332][333][334][335]

Transportation's complexity means that in most cases training an AI in a real-world driving environment is
impractical. Simulator-based testing can reduce the risks of on-road training.[336]

AI underpins self-driving vehicles. Companies involved with AI include Tesla, Waymo, and General Motors. AI-
based systems control functions such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and
mapping.[337]

Autonomous trucks are in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of
autonomous truck platoons in 2018.[338] A group of autonomous trucks follow closely behind each other.
German corporation Daimler is testing its Freightliner Inspiration.[339]

Autonomous vehicles require accurate maps to be able to navigate between destinations.[340] Some
autonomous vehicles do not allow human drivers (they have no steering wheels or pedals).[341]

AI has been used to optimize traffic management, which reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as
much as 25 percent.[342]

Smart traffic lights have been developed at Carnegie Mellon since 2009. Professor Stephen Smith has started a
company since then Surtrac that has installed smart traffic control systems in 22 cities. It costs about $20,000
per intersection to install. Drive time has been reduced by 25% and traffic jam waiting time has been reduced by
40% at the intersections it has been installed.[343]

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Air Operations Division (AOD) uses AI for expert systems. AIs operate
as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for
tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.[344]

Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make
mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated.

AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can
fly independently or in swarms.[345]
