AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS,
which is a rule-based expert system using information from TF-30 documents
and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was
designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the F-111C. The
system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to
communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having
to speak to one of the specialized workers.

Speech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to
drones.

Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,[346] or AIDA, is used to help
designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This
program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the
design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software
tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram
of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is
proving effective.

In 2003 a Dryden Flight Research Center project created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to
continue flight until a safe landing can be achieved.[347] The software compensated for damaged components by
relying on the remaining undamaged components.[348]

The 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combined apprenticeship learning and behavioral cloning whereby the
autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply
those actions.[349]

Neural networks are used by situational awareness systems in ships and boats.[350] There also are autonomous
boats.

Autonomous ships that monitor the ocean, AI-driven satellite data analysis, passive acoustics[351] or remote
sensing and other applications of environmental monitoring make use of machine learning.[352][353][354][177]

For example, "Global Plastic Watch" is an AI-based satellite monitoring-platform for analysis/tracking of plastic
waste sites to help prevention of plastic pollution – primarily ocean pollution – by helping identify who and
where mismanages plastic waste, dumping it into oceans.[355][356]

Machine learning can be used to spot early-warning signs of disasters and environmental issues, possibly
including natural pandemics,[357][358] earthquakes,[359][360][361] landslides,[362] heavy rainfall,[363] long-term
water supply vulnerability,[364] tipping-points of ecosystem collapse,[365] cyanobacterial bloom outbreaks,[366]

and droughts.[367][368][369]

AI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically
integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to
privacy.[370]

Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted.

GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence model developed by GitHub and OpenAI that is able to autocomplete
code in multiple programming languages.[371] Price for individuals: $10/mo or $100/yr, with one free month
trial.

Tabnine was created by Jacob Jackson and was originally owned by Tabnine company. In late 2019, Tabnine
was acquired by Codota.[372] Tabnine tool is available as plugin to most popular IDEs. It offers multiple pricing
options, including limited "starter" free version.[373]

CodiumAI by CodiumAI, small startup in Tel Aviv, offers automated test creation. Currently supports Python,
JS, and TS.[374]

Ghostwriter by Replit offers code completion and chat.[375] They have multiple pricing plans, including a free
one and a "Hacker" plan for $7/month.

CodeWhisperer by Amazon collects individual users' content, including files open in the IDE. They claim to
focus on security both during transmission and when storing.[376] Individual plan is free, professional plan is
$19/user/month.

Other tools: SourceGraph Cody, CodeCompleteFauxPilot, Tabby[370]

AI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve
new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet's
performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.[377]

Machine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology,[378] including quantum
sensors.[379] Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with
machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for
neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with
some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications,[380][381] and quantum machine
learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum

simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry[382][383] problems as well as for
quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications.[384] There may also be some usefulness
in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with
possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing[210][211]).[385][386][387]

AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their
inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered AI. All of the
following were originally developed in AI laboratories:[388]

Time sharing
Interactive interpreters
Graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse
Rapid application development environments
The linked list data structure
Automatic storage management
Symbolic programming
Functional programming
Dynamic programming
Object-oriented programming
Optical character recognition
Constraint satisfaction

Business websites and social media platforms for businesses like use chatbots for customer interactions like
helping in answering frequently asked questions. Chatbots offers 24/7 support and replaces humans thereby
helping in cutting business costs.

Ai prompted imagery of architecture

An optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It
can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like
employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.[389]

Artificial intelligence in architecture describes the use of artificial
intelligence in automation, design and planning in the architectural process
or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture. Artificial Intelligence
is thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in
Architecture.[390][391][392]

AI's potential in optimization of design, planning and productivity have
been noted as accelerators in the field of architectural work. The ability of AI
to potentially amplify an architect's design process has also been noted.
Fears of the replacement of aspects or core processes of the architectural
profession by Artificial Intelligence have also been raised, as well as the
philosophical implications on the profession and creativity.[390][391][392]
