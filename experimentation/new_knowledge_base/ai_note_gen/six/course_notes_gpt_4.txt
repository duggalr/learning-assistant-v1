Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, ML models are trained on data, allowing them to improve their performance over time.\n\n### Supervised Learning\nSupervised learning is a type of ML where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that each example in the training dataset is paired with the correct output. The model makes predictions or decisions based on input data and is corrected when its predictions are wrong. The main goal is to map input data to known output labels.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n- **Label:** The output variable or the target variable that we want to predict.\n- **Feature:** Input variable(s) used to make predictions.\n- **Model:** A mathematical representation or algorithm that makes predictions based on data.\n\n#### Examples:\n- Classification tasks, such as spam detection or identifying handwritten digits.\n- Regression tasks, like predicting house prices or stock market trends.\n\n### Unsupervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled, meaning the model learns patterns and relationships directly from the data without any supervision. The goal here is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about it.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together.\n- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of random variables under consideration.\n\n#### Examples:\n- Clustering customers based on purchasing behavior.\n- Reducing the dimensionality of data to simplify models without losing too much information.\n\n### Reinforcement Learning\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is different from supervised and unsupervised learning. In RL, an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. Its goal is to learn the best actions to take in a given environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n- **Agent:** The learner or decision-maker.\n- **Environment:** The world in which the agent interacts.\n- **Action:** All possible moves that the agent can take.\n- **Reward:** Feedback from the environment used to evaluate the action's impact.\n\n#### Examples:\n- Video game AI, where the agent learns to perform game tasks to maximize scores.\n- Robotics, where agents learn to perform complex tasks like walking or flying.\n\n*By focusing on these fundamentals of Machine Learning, you're building a strong foundation that will support learning more complex topics, including Neural Networks and Deep Learning, and applying these concepts in real-world applications with technologies like GPT.*"
