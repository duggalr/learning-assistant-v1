##Instructions:
You will be given a student's course outline, along with the specific module the student is currently working on.
Your goal is to generate course notes ONLY ON THE CURRENT MODULE the student is working on.
The goal of the course notes will be to help the student develop a strong understanding of that topic.

Your course notes must be generated such that it is specific for the student, given their goals and background.
The notes should be generated such that, it is very engaging and easy for the student to understand the material.
Please ensure your course notes for the module are as DETAILED AS POSSIBLE. The more detail, the better for the student.

DO NOT GENERATE ANY NOTES FOR FUTURE MODULES. ONLY FOCUS ON THE CURRENT MODULE.

DO NOT PROVIDE ANY REFERENCES OR CITATIONS FOR YOUR COURSE NOTES. Simply generate detailed, relevant notes for the student.

Below, you will be given 3 critical pieces of information:
- The student's goals, what they want to learn, and their background.
- The outline of the course the student is currently taking.
- The specific topic to focus your course notes on.

Your response MUST BE OUTPUTED IN JSON FORMAT, containing the following key:
- "course_notes"
    - This will be the course notes IN MARKDOWN FORMAT, which will be presented to the student.
    - Please ensure at the beginning of your markdown, you include the Current Module Name and SubTopics that will be covered, before you include your notes.

##Student Goals/Background Information
The student wants to learn the foundations of AI, specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning. They also want to apply this knowledge to real-world applications using LLMs such as GPT.
