AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS,
which is a rule-based expert system using information from TF-30 documents
and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was
designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for the F-111C. The
system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to
communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having
to speak to one of the specialized workers.

Speech recognition allows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to
drones.

Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,[346] or AIDA, is used to help
designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This
program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the
design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software
tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram
of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is
proving effective.

In 2003 a Dryden Flight Research Center project created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to
continue flight until a safe landing can be achieved.[347] The software compensated for damaged components by
relying on the remaining undamaged components.[348]

The 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combined apprenticeship learning and behavioral cloning whereby the
autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply
those actions.[349]

Neural networks are used by situational awareness systems in ships and boats.[350] There also are autonomous
boats.

Autonomous ships that monitor the ocean, AI-driven satellite data analysis, passive acoustics[351] or remote
sensing and other applications of environmental monitoring make use of machine learning.[352][353][354][177]

For example, "Global Plastic Watch" is an AI-based satellite monitoring-platform for analysis/tracking of plastic
waste sites to help prevention of plastic pollution – primarily ocean pollution – by helping identify who and
where mismanages plastic waste, dumping it into oceans.[355][356]

Machine learning can be used to spot early-warning signs of disasters and environmental issues, possibly
including natural pandemics,[357][358] earthquakes,[359][360][361] landslides,[362] heavy rainfall,[363] long-term
water supply vulnerability,[364] tipping-points of ecosystem collapse,[365] cyanobacterial bloom outbreaks,[366]

and droughts.[367][368][369]

AI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically
integrated with editors and IDEs as plugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to
privacy.[370]

Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted.

GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence model developed by GitHub and OpenAI that is able to autocomplete
code in multiple programming languages.[371] Price for individuals: $10/mo or $100/yr, with one free month
trial.

Tabnine was created by Jacob Jackson and was originally owned by Tabnine company. In late 2019, Tabnine
was acquired by Codota.[372] Tabnine tool is available as plugin to most popular IDEs. It offers multiple pricing
options, including limited "starter" free version.[373]

CodiumAI by CodiumAI, small startup in Tel Aviv, offers automated test creation. Currently supports Python,
JS, and TS.[374]

Ghostwriter by Replit offers code completion and chat.[375] They have multiple pricing plans, including a free
one and a "Hacker" plan for $7/month.

CodeWhisperer by Amazon collects individual users' content, including files open in the IDE. They claim to
focus on security both during transmission and when storing.[376] Individual plan is free, professional plan is
$19/user/month.

Other tools: SourceGraph Cody, CodeCompleteFauxPilot, Tabby[370]

AI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve
new neural net topologies created NASNet, a system optimized for ImageNet and POCO F1. NASNet's
performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.[377]

Machine learning has been used for noise-cancelling in quantum technology,[378] including quantum
sensors.[379] Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with
machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic, quantum memristive device for
neuromorphic (quantum-)computers (NC)/artificial neural networks and NC-using quantum materials with
some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications,[380][381] and quantum machine
learning is a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used for quantum

simulators which may have the application of solving physics and chemistry[382][383] problems as well as for
quantum annealers for training of neural networks for AI applications.[384] There may also be some usefulness
in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with
possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing[210][211]).[385][386][387]

AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their
inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered AI. All of the
following were originally developed in AI laboratories:[388]

Time sharing
Interactive interpreters
Graphical user interfaces and the computer mouse
Rapid application development environments

An optical character reader is used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It
can also be used in business contract documents e.g. employment agreements to extract critical data like
employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.[389]

Artificial intelligence in architecture describes the use of artificial
intelligence in automation, design and planning in the architectural process
or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture. Artificial Intelligence
is thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in
Architecture.[390][391][392]

AI's potential in optimization of design, planning and productivity have
been noted as accelerators in the field of architectural work. The ability of AI
to potentially amplify an architect's design process has also been noted.
Fears of the replacement of aspects or core processes of the architectural
profession by Artificial Intelligence have also been raised, as well as the
philosophical implications on the profession and creativity.[390][391][392]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence 1/51

Applications of artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in applications throughout industry and academia. Similar to
electricity or computers, AI serves as a general-purpose technology that has numerous applications. Its
applications span language translation, image recognition, decision-making,[1] credit scoring, e-commerce and
various other domains.[2]

A recommendation system predicts the rating or preference a user would give to an item.[3][4] Artificial
intelligence recommendation systems are designed to offer suggestions based on previous behavior. These
systems have been used by companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube, where they generate personalized
playlists, product suggestions, and video recommendations.[5][6]

Machine learning is also used in web feeds such as for determining which posts should show up in social media
feeds.[7][8] Various types of social media analysis also make use of machine learning[9][10] and there is research
into its use for (semi-)automated tagging/enhancement/correction of online misinformation and related filter
bubbles.[11][12][13]

AI is used to target web advertisements to those most likely to click or engage in them. It is also used to increase
time spent on a website by selecting attractive content for the viewer. It can predict or generalize the behavior of
customers from their digital footprints.[14] Both AdSense and Facebook[15] use AI for advertising.

Online gambling companies use AI to improve customer targeting.[16]

Personality computing AI models add psychological targeting to more traditional social demographics or
behavioral targeting.[17] AI has been used to customize shopping options and personalize offers.[18]

Intelligent personal assistants use AI to understand many natural language requests in other ways than
rudimentary commands. Common examples are Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and a more recent AI, ChatGPT
by OpenAI.[19]

Search engines that use artificial intelligence include Google Search[20] and Bing Chat.

Machine learning can be used to fight against spam, scams, and phishing. It can scrutinize the contents of spam
and phishing attacks to identify any malicious elements.[21] Numerous models built on machine learning
algorithms exhibit exceptional performance with accuracies over 90% in distinguishing between spam and
legitimate emails.[22]

AI has been used to automatically translate spoken language and textual content, in products such as Microsoft
Translator, Google Translate and DeepL Translator.[23] Additionally, research and development are in progress
to decode and conduct animal communication.[24][25]

AI has been used in facial recognition systems, with a 99% accuracy rate. Some examples are Apple's Face ID
and Android's Face Unlock, which are used to secure mobile devices.[26]

Image labeling has been used by Google to detect products in photos and to allow people to search based on a
photo. Image labeling has also been demonstrated to generate speech to describe images to blind people. [27]

Facebook's DeepFace identifies human faces in digital images.

Games have been a major application of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have beaten
human players in many games, including chess (Deep Blue), Jeopardy! (Watson),[28] Go
(AlphaGo),[29][30][31][32][33][34][35] poker (Pluribus[36] and Cepheus),[37] E-sports (StarCraft),[38][39] and
general game playing (AlphaZero[40][41][42] and MuZero).[43][44][45][46] AI has replaced hand-coded algorithms
in most chess programs.[47] Unlike go or chess, poker is an imperfect-information game, so a program that
plays poker has to reason under uncertainty. The general game players work using feedback from the game
system, without knowing the rules.

AI for Good is an ITU initiative supporting institutions employing AI to tackle some of the world's greatest
economic and social challenges. For example, the University of Southern California launched the Center for
Artificial Intelligence in Society, with the goal of using AI to address problems such as homelessness. At
Stanford, researchers use AI to analyze satellite images to identify high poverty areas.[48]

In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or
increasing yield.[49] Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the
ripening time for crops such as tomatoes,[50] monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct
predictive analytics,[51][52] classify livestock pig call emotions,[24] automate greenhouses,[53] detect diseases and
pests,[54][55] and save water.[56]

Cyber security companies are adopting neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing to
improve their systems.[57]

Applications of AI in cyber security include:

Language translation

Facial recognition and image labeling

Network protection: Machine learning improves intrusion detection systems by broadening the search
beyond previously identified threats.
Endpoint protection: Attacks such as ransomware can be thwarted by learning typical malware behaviors.
Application security: can help counterattacks such as server-side request forgery, SQL injection, cross-site
scripting, and distributed denial-of-service.
Suspect user behavior: Machine learning can identify fraud or compromised applications as they occur.[58]

Google fraud czar Shuman Ghosemajumder has said that AI will be used to completely automate most cyber
security operations over time.[59]

AI tutors such as Khanmigo and Duolingo allow students to get one-on-one help.[60] They can reduce anxiety
and stress for students stemming from tutor labs or human tutors.[61]

AI applications that hinder students' ability to stay on task, such as recommender systems, can create a
dysfunctional environment, sometimes with revenge effects.[62][63] AI can be also used to provide early
prediction of student success in a virtual learning environment (VLE) such as Moodle.[64]

In the education process, students can personalize their training with the help of artificial intelligence. And for
teaching professionals, the technology provided by AI can improve the quality of the educational process and
teaching skills.[65]

Since the launch of OpenAI's API in 2022, some students have used the software to generate their essay
assignments.[66] AI text detectors can be used to scan essays generated by artificial intelligence in order to try to
establish genuine authorship. However, a study found that seven of the most used of these detectors often
wrongly flagged articles written by those whose first language was not English as AI-generated, thus
discriminating against so called 'non-native' English speakers.[67]

Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the
norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI in banking began in 1987 when Security Pacific
National Bank launched a fraud prevention taskforce to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[68] Kasisto
and Moneystream use AI.

Banks use AI to organize operations, for bookkeeping, investing in stocks, and managing properties. AI can
react to changes when business is not taking place.[69] AI is used to combat fraud and financial crimes by
monitoring behavioral patterns for any abnormal changes or anomalies.[70][71][72]

The use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision making has changed major economic
theories.[73] For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate individualized demand and supply
curves and thus enable individualized pricing. AI machines reduce information asymmetry in the market and
thus make markets more efficient.[74] The application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry can
alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises. Especially for smaller and more innovative
enterprises.[75]

Algorithmic trading involves the use of AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds orders of magnitude
greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Such
high-frequency trading represents a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now

have entire portfolios that are AI-managed. Automated trading systems are typically used by large institutional
investors but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems.[76]

Large financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices. BlackRock's AI engine, Aladdin, is
used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions include the use of
natural language processing to analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges
the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank use
SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles
and match them with wealth management products.[77]

Online lender Upstart uses machine learning for underwriting.[78]

ZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This
platform uses machine learning to analyze data including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a
form to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit
histories.[79]

AI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of
assurance, and reducing audit duration.[80]

AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used for anti-
money laundering (AML).[81][82] AI can be used to "develop the AML pipeline into a robust, scalable solution
with a reduced false p
tic coverage of amateur soccer, set to cover 60,000 games
in just a single season. NDC partnered with United Robots to create this algorithm and cover what would have
never been able to be done before without an extremely large team.[281]

Lede AI has been used in 2023 to take scores from high school football games to generate stories automatically
for the local news paper. This was met with a lot of criticism from readers for the very robotic diction that was
published. With some descriptions of games being a "close encounter of the athletic kind," readers were not
pleased and let the publishing company, Gannett, know on social media. Gannett has since halted their used of
Lede AI until they come up with a solution for what they call an experiment.[282]

Artificial intelligence is used in Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects for the purpose of developing those
projects.[283][284] Human and bot interaction in Wikimedia projects is routine and iterative.[285]

Millions of its articles have been edited by bots[286] which however are usually not artificial intelligence
software. Many AI platforms use Wikipedia data,[287] mainly for training machine learning applications. There
is research and development of various artificial intelligence applications for Wikipedia such as for identifying
outdated sentences,[288] detecting covert vandalism[289] or recommending articles and tasks to new editors.

Machine translation has also be used for translating Wikipedia articles and could play a larger role in creating,
updating, expanding, and generally improving articles in the future. A content translation tool allows editors of
some Wikipedias to more easily translate articles across several select languages.[290][291]

In video games, AI is routinely used to generate behavior in non-player characters (NPCs). In addition, AI is
used for pathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a "solved problem" for most production
tasks. Games with less typical AI include the AI director of Left 4 Dead (2008) and the neuroevolutionary
training of platoons in Supreme Commander 2 (2010).[292][293] AI is also used in Alien Isolation (2014) as a
way to control the actions the Alien will perform next.[294]

Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One, uses algorithms that
emerged from AI research.[295]

AI has been used to produce visual art. The first AI art program, called
AARON, was developed by Harold Cohen in 1968[296] with the goal of being
able to code the act of drawing. It started by creating simple black and white
drawings, and later to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen
by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.[297]

AI platforms such as "DALL-E",[298] Stable Diffusion,[298] Imagen,[299] and
Midjourney[300] have been used for generating visual images from inputs
such as text or other images.[301] Some AI tools allow users to input images
and output changed versions of that image, such as to display an object or
product in different environments. AI image models can also attempt to
replicate the specific styles of artists, and can add visual complexity to rough
sketches.

Since their design in 2014, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have
been used by AI artists. GAN computer programming, generates technical images through machine learning
frameworks that surpass the need for human operators.[296] Examples of GAN programs that generate art
include Artbreeder and DeepDream.

In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively
analyze digital art collections. Although the main goal of the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few
decades was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has
brought about new research perspectives.[302] Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing,
are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.[303] While distant viewing includes the analysis of large
collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork.

AI has been in use since the early 2000s, most notably by a system designed by Pixar called "Genesis".[304] It
was designed to learn algorithms and create 3D models for its characters and props. Notable movies that used
this technology included Up and The Good Dinosaur.[305] AI has been used less ceremoniously in recent years.
In 2023, it was revealed Netflix of Japan was using AI to generate background images for their upcoming show

to be met with backlash online.[306] In recent years, motion capture became an easily accessible form of AI
animation. For example, Move AI is a program built to capture any human movement and reanimate it in its
animation program using learning AI.[307]

Power electronics converters are used in renewable energy, energy storage, electric vehicles and high-voltage
direct current transmission. These converters are failure-prone, which can interrupt service and require costly
maintenance or catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications. AI can guide the design process for
reliable power electronics converters, by calculating exact design parameters that ensure the required
lifetime.[308]

Machine learning can be used for energy consumption prediction and scheduling, e.g. to help with renewable
energy intermittency management (see also: smart grid and climate change mitigation in the power
grid).[309][310][311][312]

Many telecommunications companies make use of heuristic search to manage their workforces. For example,
BT Group deployed heuristic search[313] in an application that schedules 20,000 engineers. Machine learning is
also used for speech recognition (SR), including of voice-controlled devices, and SR-related transcription,
including of videos.[314][315]

Artificial intelligence has been combined with digital spectrometry by IdeaCuria Inc.,[316][317] enable
applications such as at-home water quality monitoring.

In the 1990s early AIs controlled Tamagotchis and Giga Pets, the Internet, and the first widely released robot,
Furby. Aibo was a domestic robot in the form of a robotic dog with intelligent features and autonomy.

Mattel created an assortment of AI-enabled toys that "understand" conversations, give intelligent responses,
and learn.[318]

Oil and gas companies have used artificial intelligence tools to automate functions, foresee equipment issues,
and increase oil and gas output.[319][320]

AI in transport is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable
transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and
communities. The major development challenge is the complexity of
transportation systems that involves independent components and parties,
with potentially conflicting objectives.[321]

AI-based fuzzy logic controllers operate gearboxes. For example, the 2006
Audi TT, VW Touareg and VW Caravell feature the DSP transmission. A
number of Škoda variants (Škoda Fabia) include a fuzzy logic-based
controller. Cars have AI-based driver-assist features such as self-parking
and adaptive cruise control.

There are also prototypes of autonomous automotive public transport vehicles such as electric mini-
buses[322][323][324][325] as well as autonomous rail transport in operation.[326][327][328]

There also are prototypes of autonomous delivery vehicles, sometimes including delivery
robots.[329][330][331][332][333][334][335]

Transportation's complexity means that in most cases training an AI in a real-world driving environment is
impractical. Simulator-based testing can reduce the risks of on-road training.[336]

AI underpins self-driving vehicles. Companies involved with AI include Tesla, Waymo, and General Motors. AI-
based systems control functions such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and
mapping.[337]

Autonomous trucks are in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of
autonomous truck platoons in 2018.[338] A group of autonomous trucks follow closely behind each other.
German corporation Daimler is testing its Freightliner Inspiration.[339]

Autonomous vehicles require accurate maps to be able to navigate between destinations.[340] Some
autonomous vehicles do not allow human drivers (they have no steering wheels or pedals).[341]

AI has been used to optimize traffic management, which reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as
much as 25 percent.[342]

Smart traffic lights have been developed at Carnegie Mellon since 2009. Professor Stephen Smith has started a
company since then Surtrac that has installed smart traffic control systems in 22 cities. It costs about $20,000
per intersection to install. Drive time has been reduced by 25% and traffic jam waiting time has been reduced by
40% at the intersections it has been installed.[343]

The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Air Operations Division (AOD) uses AI for expert systems. AIs operate
as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for
tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.[344]

Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make
mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated.

AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can
fly independently or in swarms.[345]
