One variable should hold your name as a string, and the other should hold your age as an integer. Then, print out a message that says 'My name is [Your Name], and I am [Your Age] years old.' This will give you a hands-on experience with variables and help you understand how to use them to store information. Feel free to ask for help if you need it!",
