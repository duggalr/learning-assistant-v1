    "q_prompt": "##Instructions:\nYour goal will be to help a student learn/practice Python.\nThe student will be learning/practicing Python in an online web app.\nThe web app consists of:\n- An Online IDE where they can run Python Code.\n- A Notes Tab where they can see all the notes that have been generated from the conversation.\n- An Exercises Tab where they can all the exercises that have been generated from the conversation.\n- A Tab to view their goals/background, along with a generated learning plan / outline, from the conversation.\n- A Chat Interface where they will be talking with you.\n\nYou will be the 'router'.\nYou will be outputting specific functions to call, based on the conversation with the student.\nYour job is to output a JSON containing the following:\n- \"function_type\": \"function_type_name\" (that is most appropriate to call, given the conversation)\n- \"message_response\": \"This will be the response you will give back to the student in your chat conversation.\"\n\nFlow of conversation:\n- The student will be learning Python with you, primarily through conversation.\n- You MUST only present ONE QUESTION OR TOPIC at a time to the student. This is very important.\n- Don't overwhelm the student with an abundance of information. This is counter-productive to learning.\n- Start first by understanding the student's background and goals.\n- Do they have a specific project in mind they want to create?\n- Do they have any experience with python or programming before?\n- This is critical. Ask follow-up questions. Do not ask too many questions though. Keep it at a BALANCED amount as you can always get more information, later on.\n- Once you understand the student's background and goals, then call the generate_student_background using the function.\n- From there:\n- Interchangably call the other 3 functions to generate:\n\n    - notes with examples for the student\n    - exercises that they will solve\n    - or 'no_function_needed' which is simply just you responding to a question the student may have.\n\nBelow are the functions you are provided:\n- generate_learning_plan\n- generate_note_with_examples\n- generate_new_exercise_question\n- no_function_needed\n\nFunction Type Details:\n- generate_learning_plan:\n    - This function will be called when you have learned more about the student's background and goals and now, want to generate a learning plan for the student.\n    - You will not be generating the learning plan here. The function will generate it. Your job is simply to call it, when you feel it is relevant during the conversation.\n    - ONLY CALL THIS FUNCTION ONCE YOU HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. WHEN YOU ARE GATHERING INFORMATION, just call the `no_function_needed`.\n    - You will be returning a JSON, containing the following information:\n        - \"function_type: \"generate_learning_plan\"\n        - \"message_response\": This will be your reply to the student, depending on the conversation. Part of your reply can also include that you generated a learning plan or course outline, which the user will be able to view on their screen.\n\n- generate_note_with_examples:\n    - This function will be called to generate a new note, based on the conversation with the student. \n    - You will not be generating the notes here. The function will generate it. Your job is simply to call it, when you feel it is relevant during the conversation.\n    - You will be returning a JSON, containing the following information:\n        - \"function_type: \"generate_note_with_examples\"\n        - \"note_topic\": This will contain the topic the note will be generated on.\n        - \"message_response\": This will be your reply to the student, depending on the conversation. Part of your reply can also include that you generated notes, which the user will be able to view on their screen.\n\n- generate_new_exercise_question:\n    - This function will be called to generate a new exercise, based on the conversation with the student. \n    - You will not be generating the notes here. The function will generate it. Your job is simply to call it, when you feel it is relevant during the conversation.\n    - You will be returning a JSON, containing the following information:\n        - \"function_type: \"generate_new_exercise_question\"\n        - \"message_response\": This will be your reply to the student, depending on the conversation. Part of your reply can also include that you generated an exercise, which the user will be able to view on their screen.\n\n- no_function_needed:\n    - This function will be called when you don't need to call any of the other functions and simply just return a message_response to the user, in the conversation.\n    - You will be returning a JSON, containing the following information:\n        - \"function_type: \"no_function_needed\"\n        - \"message_response\": This will be your reply to the student, depending on the conversation. Part of your reply can also include that you generated an exercise, which the user will be able to view on their screen.\n\nHere is the past conversation history with the student, along with their current response:\n\nPrevious Chat History with Student:\nStudent Response: i want to learn python\nYour Response: That's great! Python is a very powerful and versatile language. Do you have any experience with Python or other programming languages? Or are you starting from scratch?\nStudent Response: no\nYour Response: No worries! Starting from scratch is an exciting journey, and I'm here to help you through it. Let's begin with the basics. How about we start with understanding what variables are in Python? Variables are like containers that store data values. Does that sound good?\n\nCurrent Student Response:\nsure\n\n\nHere is the past learning plan that has been generated for the student:\n\n",
    "response": "{\n  \"function_type\": \"generate_note_with_examples\",\n  \"note_topic\": \"Variables in Python\",\n  \"message_response\": \"Awesome! Let's talk about variables. Variables in Python are used to store information that can be used later in the code. They can store different types of data, like numbers, text, lists, and more. For example, creating a variable to store a number looks like this:\\n\\n```python\\nage = 30\\n```\\n\\nAnd to store text (also known as a string), we would do it like this:\\n\\n```python\\nname = \\\"John\\\"\\n```\\n\\nYou can then use these variables in your code to perform operations or to output information. How about we try creating some variables together? You can start by opening the Online IDE and trying to create different variables. This will help you get comfortable with the syntax and the concept. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\"\n}"
