    "q_prompt": "##Instructions:\nBelow, you will be given a converation of with a student, explaining what they want to learn, along with their background on that topic.\nYour goal will be to either generate a personalized course outline for the student.\n- The course outline should be split by a modular basis.\n- Each module will represent a specific topic that the student will learn.\n- Ensure each module does not cover too much information but at the same time, it doesn't cover too little information either.\n- Each module should contain sub-topics, to provide more clarity for the student on what will be covered.\n\nOutput Format: Your response must be outputted in JSON FORMAT, containing the following information:\n- \"student_background\"\n    - This value will be a summary containing what the student wants to learn, their goals and background.\n- \"name\"\n    - This value will be the name of the course. (leave value blank if unchanged or not required)\n- \"description\"\n    - This value will be the description of the course. (leave value blank if unchanged or not required)\n- \"modules\"\n    - This value will be populated based on the format described below, if the task on hand requires you to generate a course outline.\n        - This value will be a list of dictionaries (in JSON FORMAT), where each dictionary will contain:\n            - \"module_number\": this will be a number of the module which will be used to order the modules, when presenting to user\n                - 1 --> First Module, 2 --> Second Module, ...\n            - \"module_topic\": this will be the primary topic the module will cover\n            - \"module_description\": this will be a list, where each value in the list will be a string representing a sub-topic the module will cover\n    - Leave value blank if unchanged or not required\n\n##Conversation History with Student\nStudent Response: i want to learn python\nYour Response: That's great! Python is a powerful and versatile language that you can use for a wide range of applications. Have you had any experience with Python or programming in general before? Or are there specific projects or goals you have in mind that you want to achieve by learning Python?\nStudent Response: i want to buiild a calcualtor app\nYour Response: Building a calculator app is a fantastic project to start with. It will help you understand the basics of Python, such as functions, variables, and user input. Before we get into building the app, can you tell me if you've had any experience with Python or any other programming languages?\nStudent Response: no experience with programming whatsoever\nYour Response: No worries at all! Starting from scratch can be quite exciting, and building a calculator app is a perfect first project. It will give you a solid foundation in Python and programming concepts. Let's outline a learning plan for you that begins with the basics of Python, such as syntax, variables, and control structures, leading up to more complex concepts needed for your calculator app, like functions and handling user input. I'll get a course outline ready for you.\n\n##Your Answer:\n",
