Symmetric-key encryption: the same key is used for
both encryption and decryption

Symmetric-key algorithm
Symmetric-key algorithms[a] are algorithms for
cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys
for both the encryption of plaintext and the
decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical,
or there may be a simple transformation to go
between the two keys.[1] The keys, in practice,
represent a shared secret between two or more
parties that can be used to maintain a private
information link.[2] The requirement that both
parties have access to the secret key is one of the
main drawbacks of symmetric-key encryption, in
comparison to public-key encryption (also known as
asymmetric-key encryption).[3][4] However, symmetric-key encryption algorithms are usually better
for bulk encryption. With exception of the one-time pad they have a smaller key size, which means less
storage space and faster transmission. Due to this, asymmetric-key encryption is often used to
exchange the secret key for symmetric-key encryption.[5][6][7]

Symmetric-key encryption can use either stream ciphers or block ciphers.[8]

Stream ciphers encrypt the digits (typically bytes), or letters (in substitution ciphers) of a message one
at a time. An example is ChaCha20. Substitution ciphers are well-known ciphers, but can be easily
decrypted using a frequency table.[9]

Block ciphers take a number of bits and encrypt them in a single unit, padding the plaintext to achieve
a multiple of the block size. The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, approved by NIST
in December 2001, uses 128-bit blocks.

Examples of popular symmetric-key algorithms include Twofish, Serpent, AES (Rijndael), Camellia,
Salsa20, ChaCha20, Blowfish, CAST5, Kuznyechik, RC4, DES, 3DES, Skipjack, Safer, and IDEA.[10]

Symmetric ciphers are commonly used to achieve other cryptographic primitives than just encryption.

Encrypting a message does not guarantee that it will remain unchanged while encrypted. Hence, often
a message authentication code is added to a ciphertext to ensure that changes to the ciphertext will be
noted by the receiver. Message authentication codes can be constructed from an AEAD cipher (e.g.
AES-GCM).

However, symmetric ciphers cannot be used for non-repudiation purposes except by involving
additional parties.[11] See the ISO/IEC 13888-2 standard (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catal
ogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44736).

Another application is to build hash functions from block ciphers. See one-way compression function
for descriptions of several such methods.

Many modern block ciphers are based on a construction proposed by Horst Feistel. Feistel's
construction makes it possible to build invertible functions from other functions that are themselves
not invertible.

Symmetric ciphers have historically been susceptible to known-plaintext attacks, chosen-plaintext
attacks, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis. Careful construction of the functions for
each round can greatly reduce the chances of a successful attack. It is also possible to increase the key
length or the rounds in the encryption process to better protect against attack. This, however, tends to
increase the processing power and decrease the speed at which the process runs due to the amount of
operations the system needs to do.[12]

Most modern symmetric-key algorithms appear to be resistant to the threat of post-quantum
cryptography.[13] Quantum computers would exponentially increase the speed at which these ciphers
can be decoded; notably, Grover's algorithm would take the square-root of the time traditionally
required for a brute-force attack, although these vulnerabilities can be compensated for by doubling
key length.[14] For example, a 128 bit AES cipher would not be secure against such an attack as it
would reduce the time required to test all possible iterations from over 10 quintillion years to about
six months. By contrast, it would still take a quantum computer the same amount of time to decode a
256 bit AES cipher as it would a conventional computer to decode a 128 bit AES cipher.[15] For this
reason, AES-256 is believed to be "quantum resistant".[16][17]

Symmetric-key algorithms require both the sender and the recipient of a message to have the same
secret key. All early cryptographic systems required either the sender or the recipient to somehow
receive a copy of that secret key over a physically secure channel.

Nearly all modern cryptographic systems still use symmetric-key algorithms internally to encrypt the
bulk of the messages, but they eliminate the need for a physically secure channel by using Diffie–
Hellman key exchange or some other public-key protocol to securely come to agreement on a fresh
new secret key for each session/conversation (forward secrecy).

When used with asymmetric ciphers for key transfer, pseudorandom key generators are nearly always
used to generate the symmetric cipher session keys. However, lack of randomness in those generators
or in their initialization vectors is disastrous and has led to cryptanalytic breaks in the past. Therefore,
it is essential that an implementation use a source of high entropy for its initialization.[18][19][20]

A reciprocal cipher is a cipher where, just as one enters the plaintext into the cryptography system to
get the ciphertext, one could enter the ciphertext into the same place in the system to get the plaintext.
A reciprocal cipher is also sometimes referred as self-reciprocal cipher.[21][22]

Practically all mechanical cipher machines implement a reciprocal cipher, a mathematical involution
on each typed-in letter. Instead of designing two kinds of machines, one for encrypting and one for
decrypting, all the machines can be identical and can be set up (keyed) the same way.[23]

Examples of reciprocal ciphers include:

Atbash
Beaufort cipher[24]

Enigma machine[25]

Marie Antoinette and Axel von Fersen communicated with a self-reciprocal cipher.[26]

the Porta polyalphabetic cipher is self-reciprocal.[27]

Purple cipher[28]
RC4
ROT13
XOR cipher
Vatsyayana cipher

The majority of all modern ciphers can be classified as either a stream cipher, most of which use a
reciprocal XOR cipher combiner, or a block cipher, most of which use a Feistel cipher or Lai–Massey
scheme with a reciprocal transformation in each round.[29]

private-key encryption. Use of the last and first terms can create ambiguity with similar terminology
