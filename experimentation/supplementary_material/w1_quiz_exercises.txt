### Exercises

1. **Implement Basic Symmetric Encryption**: Using Python, implement a simple symmetric encryption scheme. Generate a pseudo-random key and use it to encrypt and decrypt a message using XOR operation. Test your implementation by encrypting a short message and then decrypting it back to verify the original message is retrieved.

2. **Analyze AES and DES**: Write a Python program that uses the PyCryptoDome library to encrypt and decrypt a piece of text using both AES and DES. Compare the time taken for both encryption and decryption processes, and reflect on why AES is preferred over DES in contemporary cryptographic practices.

3. **Key Management Simulation**: Develop a Python script that simulates the secure exchange of a symmetric key between two parties. You can use a simple protocol of your choice for the key exchange. The focus should be on demonstrating the importance of keeping the key secret from outsiders while securely sharing it between the sender and receiver.

4. **DIY Encryption Algorithm**: Challenge yourself by creating a customized encryption algorithm in Python using basic string manipulation and mathematical operations. Ensure your algorithm uses a symmetric key approach. Afterward, analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your algorithm in terms of security and efficiency.

5. **Exploration of Block Cipher Modes**: Research the different modes of operation for block ciphers (e.g., ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and GCM). For one of these modes, write a Python script that demonstrates encrypting and decrypting a message using AES with the selected mode. Discuss the implications of choosing this mode over others in terms of security advantages or potential vulnerabilities.

In completing these exercises, the student will deepen their understanding of symmetric cryptography principles, key management, and algorithm implementation. They'll also gain hands-on experience in programming encryption algorithms, laying a solid foundation for further exploration in the field of cryptography.
