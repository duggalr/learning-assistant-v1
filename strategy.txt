- Problem: 
    - Students do not have access to personalized teaching available to them
        -  In other words, a scalable personalized education solution does not exist 
            - ie. one-to-one teaching for every student in the world

- Potential Solution:
    - A personalized tutor for every student, powered by AI
        - A strong AI-based tutor, which students can leverage to get help on their homework, assignments, lecture notes, by asking questions
        - Students can ask questions, work on solutions, and continuously get guidance on their work, by asking quesitons to the AI
        - Like a good tutor, the AI will not provide the solution to the problem (ie. like chat-gpt)
            - Rather, it will help guide the students thinking and improve it
            


V1 Solution:
- Code Companion
    - An AI tutor which helps students solve programming questions
        - The tool will help guide the student to the correct answer, forcing them to think at each step.

    - Current Features:
        - Programming Python Tutor to help guide you to the answer
            - Upload your own code and utilize the programming tutor to help solve your questions / problems
        - Python exercises that students can solve to help them learn programming, with tutor there to help guide them



Problem: 
- How to get initial traction to site?

- "Initial Outreach:"
    - create more videos on youtube, where app is used to: <-- upload below videos to youtube
        - go through the 'in-house' python exercises and solve one in the video, with code-companion
        - go through leetcode question, and use code-companion to help solve it

    - create a twitter:
        - share gifs of the above
    
    - create a medium:
        - write a few blog-posts and links to videos / gifs with the AI
            - ensure it links back to my site

    - create a linkedin:
        - personal profile
        - company profile
            - explicitly mention the problem I'm solving 
            - display articles, links to videos, etc. on there
    
    - put site out on specific reddits
        - avoid school ones for now
        - do learnprogramming, learnpython, etc.


Problem:
- Which features to prioritize next?

Ideas:
- PDF Upload's
    - Test out with problem sets, lecture notes, tutorial notes/quizzes, etc.  <-- making it general-purpose (change sitename)
        - make videos and gifs about this as well
            - put on youtube / twitter

- Modifying site to make it more general-purpose:
    - For coding, math, writing, anything...
        - less of an emphasis of 'own in-house courses' for now
            - more of an emphasis on helping students with their existing courses / coursework

- Improving the course:
    - Adding more python exercises

- Adding a writing tutor
    - actually helping you write better
        - simpler just text editor with writing 
            - set a challenge to write on a specific topic / question of interest 
                - AI will provide feedback, or guide you to think in different manner

- Enabling easier creation of CRUD of lessons / exercises (for me)
