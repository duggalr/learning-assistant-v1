                        Code Companion is a GPT-4 based assistant, that helps answer any programming questions or difficulties you run into.
                        Simply write your code in our <a href="{% url 'playground' %}">online editor</a> (currently supports Python), and ask any questions you have to our assistant.

                            Code Companion is not here to give you the answer. Instead, just like a great tutor, it will help guide you in the right direction by asking you questions.
                            It will force you to think through the problem so you can figure out the solution on your own.

                                    Here's our rule of thumb:
                                </strong>
                                Don't share code that you aren't comfortable with OpenAI using or seeing.
                                <br/><br/>
                                We leverage OpenAI's API to enable the user to ask questions.
                                This obviously requires us to send data to OpenAI's servers, where they will return the correct response.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Thus, if you don't feel comfortable sharing something with OpenAI, don't share it here.
                                This is primarily meant to be a place to allow students, beginners, to get help as they start learning programming.
