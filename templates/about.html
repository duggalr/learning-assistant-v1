                        Problem
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Students do not have access to a personalized, 1-to-1 educational system. 
                        There is no scalable solution that exists, to allow a personalized 1-to-1 education for each student.
                        
                        <br/><br/>
                        It should come as no surprise that offering a more personalized education approach
                        is a more optimal medium for fostering student learning, compared to the generalized education system 
                        we currently rely on.

                        <br/><br/>
                        
                        <strong>For students, some of the advantages can include:</strong>
                        <ul class="ui list" >
                        <li>Develop a greater understanding of the material.</li>
                        <li>Progress at their own pace, going on their own learning tangents.</li>
                        <li>Develop greater intrinsic motivation for the material they are learning, and learning more generally.</li>
                        <li>Develop greater confidence in themselves, feeling less pressured by external factors.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <br/>
                        We are at a pivotal point in technology, where we now have a general AI system (GPT-4)
                        which can be used to perform many different tasks, in a (mostly) reliable manner.
                        <br/><br/>
                        I believe Code Companion, which leverages GPT-4 (as described below), is the first step towards creating
                        a more personalized educational system for students.
                        <br/><br/>
                        AI, nor software alone will enabled personalized education. Teachers will always play a pivotal role.
                        <br/><br/>
                        However, the current AI systems do enable a new paradigm of software, which can be leveraged in the classroom,
                        to serve as a strong medium to help create a more personalized education environment for each student.
                        <br/><br/>

                    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
                    
                    <p>

                        <br/><br/>
                        As an initial solution to the problem described above, I built Code Companion, a GPT-4 personalized tutor
                        designed to help students with programming-specific questions or difficulties.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Like a good tutor, Code Companion will not give you the answer.
                        Instead, just like a great tutor, it will help guide you in the right direction by asking you questions.
                        <br/><br/>
                        It will force you to think through the problem so you can figure out the solution on your own.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <strong>Currently with Code Companion, you can:</strong>

                        <ul class="ui list" >
                            <!-- <li style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5em;"> -->
                        <li>
                            Utilize our In-Built Editor & Interpreter, where you can work on the question, and ask Code Companion for help at every step along the way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ask Code Companion to generate thorough explanations and examples for specific concepts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ask Code Companion to generate questions to help reinforce your understanding of specific concepts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ask Code Companion to provide feedback, or a potential new way to think about a problem.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We have in-built <a href="{% url 'lesson_dashboard' %}">Python exercises</a>, for you to experience/use the AI, while gaining foundational programming knowledge.
                        </li>
                            
                        </ul>

                                    Here's our rule of thumb:
                                </strong>
                                Don't share code that you aren't comfortable with OpenAI using or seeing.
                                <br/><br/>
                                We leverage OpenAI's API to enable the user to ask questions.
                                This obviously requires us to send data to OpenAI's servers, where they will return the correct response.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Thus, if you don't feel comfortable sharing something with OpenAI, don't share it here.
                                This is primarily meant to be a place to allow students, beginners, to get help as they start learning programming.
