                        Welcome! Below are several exercises, to help you learn the foundational concepts in Pyhton Programming.                        
                    </strong>
                    <br/><br/>
                    The exercises are ordered by level of difficulty, where they continue to get harder the further down you go.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The goal of these exercises are to:
                    <br>
                    - Provide you with a solid understanding of the foundational concepts in Python programming.
                    <br>
                    - Leverage Code Companion, whom you can ask questions to when you need help.
                    <br/><br/>
                    If you are new to Python or want to brush up on the basics, check out a few videos I made here (TODO:), where I explain some fundamental concepts while going through some of the exercises below.
                    <!-- It aims to provide you with a high-level understanding of foundational concepts in Python programming.

                    <strong>
                        This course is exercise heavy! It is primarily tailored for those who learn by doing.
                        You'll also have access to Code Companion, a personalized Tutor (powered by GPT-4), whom you can ask questions to when you need help.
                    </strong> While it won't provide answers, it will offer valuable hints and steer you in the right direction.
                    <br/><br/>                    
                    Each lesson offers valuable links to key concepts at the top. If you prefer a lecture-based course, you may consider starting with <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/video_galleries/lecture-videos/">this</a>. You can always return here later to complete the exercises.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I hope this course can serve as a starting point on your journey into the world of computer science. -->
