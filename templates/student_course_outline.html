        <!-- <h4>Introduction and Practical Applications of Symmetric Cryptograph</h4>
        <p>
            This course outline entails a step-by-step comprehensive guide for learning about basic ciphers, specifically substitutions, 
            with focus on practical implementation using Python. Owing to the student's familiarity with Python, we have incorporated relevant code implementation 
            into our weekly plan. The course starts with a foundational understanding of cryptography and basic ciphers, progresses towards an in-depth 
            understanding of substitution ciphers, and finally leads to the desired project implementation. The plan is designed to match the student's 
            available time of 10 hours per week, but is subject to change depending on the student's progress and learning pace.
